# IFRC Alert Hub

This repository contains the frontend code for the IFRC Alert Hub. The goal of the IFRC Alert Hub is to ensure that communities everywhere receive the most timely and effective emergency alerting possible, and can thereby take action to safeguard their lives and livelihoods.

## UI Designs

We have ensured that the UI designs are in accordance with the [IFRC GO&#39;s Brand Design &amp; Guidelines](https://go-user-library.ifrc.org/brand-design/). By closely following these guidelines, we have maintained consistency and reinforced the brand identity throughout the application.

To implement these UI designs effectively, we have leveraged Material-UI, a widely used open-source UI library. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) adheres to the Material Design guidelines established by Google and provides a comprehensive collection of pre-designed components, icons, and utilities that seamlessly integrate with React applications.

By utilising Material-UI, we were able to achieve a consistent and modern design throughout the IFRC Alert Hub Frontend. The library's extensive set of components, ranging from buttons to inputs and modals, ensured a cohesive and visually pleasing user interface. As a result, since the components are highly customisable, it allowed us to tailor their appearance and behavior to match the IFRC brand and design guidelines.

For a more detailed view of the UI designs implemented, you can refer to the Figma UI Designs available at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/JjBcwGTY83vzJRSw61mIxW/IFRC-Alert-Hub?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=gISfqCqQGjiRJ0OQ-1). These designs serve as a reference for the visual elements and layout we have implemented in the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js [v19.6.0] or higher is installed.
- Yarn [1.22.19] or npm [9.4.0] is installed (depending on your preferred package manager).

## Technologies

Technology Stack The client application is developed using React 16.8 and TypeScript, utilising the create-react-app framework as its foundation.

- Routing: [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
- HTTP client: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- GraphQL client: [apollo-client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
- Form validation: [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- Form Builder: [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)
- Linting and formatting: [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Styling: [material-ui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui)
- Testing: [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) and [axios-mock-adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter)

The usage of TypeScript enhances development by providing type safety, static analysis, and comprehensive code completion.
Both the client and backend components share the same type definitions to ensure consistency across the entire system.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run IFRC GO Make Maps Frontend:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IFRC-Alert-Hub/Alert-Hub-Frontend.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Testing

Both client and server are tested using Jest.

```shell
npm run test
```

Jest provides a couple of advanced features, for instance you can generate a coverage report with `npm run test -- --coverage` or run tests in an interactive loop via `npm run test -- --watch`.

## Build and deployment

### Local builds

To build the software locally, run

```shell
# build client
cd client
npm run build
```

### Building and running the docker images

![Docker Nginx Deployment Diagram](https://github.com/IFRC-Alert-Hub/Alert-Hub-Frontend/assets/57798047/57f50040-af4f-41dd-a8b9-021b4ca84d64)

The deployment of the application is facilitated by Docker and Nginx as seen in the image above. This setup combines these technologies to create a smooth and effective deployment process.

It's important to note that the practical deployment strategy makes use of Docker. Both a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml are included for both the client application, and the standard development process involves leveraging Azure to construct and distribute the application.

```shell
# building the application locally
docker-compose up

```

# Azure setup

```bash
## Azure Setup

   - Operating System: Select "Linux".
   - Publish: Choose "Docker Container".
   - Region: Select a region close to your target users for better performance.
   - App Service Plan: Create a new plan or use an existing one, and select the desired pricing tier.

6. Click the "Next: Docker" button to configure your container settings.

7. Choose "Single Container" as your container type.

8. Select "GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)" as your registry.

9. Enter the image name and tag in the "Image and tag" field (e.g., `ghcr.io/yourusername/yourprojectname:latest`).

10. Click "Review + create" to review your Web App settings.

11. After reviewing, click "Create" to deploy your Web App.

12. Once your Web App is created, navigate to the "Deployment Center" in your Web App's settings.

13. Choose "GitHub Actions" as your deployment method and follow the instructions to configure the GitHub Actions workflow.

Make sure to update the `env.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` value in your GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) with the name you chose for your Web App.
